# Introduction to GraphQL

**GraphQL:** GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. GraphQL was developed internally by Facebook in 2012 before being publicly released in 2015.
GraphQL provides an approach to developing web APIs and has been compared and contrasted with REST and other web service architectures. It allows clients to define the structure of the data required, and the same structure of the data is returned from the server. This prevents excessively large amounts of data from being returned, but can impede web caching of query results. 

This is Graph QL learning project from tutorials of net ninja.
